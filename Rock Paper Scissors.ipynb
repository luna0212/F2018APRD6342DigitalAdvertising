    "# Introduction to Python - Rock-Paper-Scissors exercise\n",
    "- The program allows a user to compete against a computer in the “Rock-Paper- Scissors” game.\n",
    "- The program asks a user to input a choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). (Note: the program should be able to handle incorrect user input.)\n",
    "- The program (computer) generates its own choice (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). \n",
    "- The program compares the choice of the user against its own choice and calculates a score.\n",
    "- The program always shows the score to the user.\n",
    "- The program continues until either the program or the user has “three” wins. "
